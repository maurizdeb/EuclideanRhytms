Euclidean rhythms are all drum patterns that can be generated through the Euclidean Algorithm. This class of rhythms, was discovered in 2005 by Godfried Touissant\cite{Toussaint:2004:euclidean:rhythm}. He found that those patterns are often present in music from various parts of the world and different time periods. Since then, Euclidean rhythm generators started to spread in music production, since with very few parameters one can generate very complex patterns and polyrhythms. A lot of eurorack synthesizer modules have been developed since then like the Qbit blab la, bla bla and blab la, just to name a few. This paper will present a software implementation of a drum machine capable of generating Euclidean rhythms, using Supercollider programming language.
